# Angular Patterns

## Structure

- Prefer **standalone components** and explicit `imports` when that is the project standard; otherwise follow existing module layout.
- Keep **smart vs presentational** split where the codebase already does: containers handle data/orchestration; dumb components take `@Input()` / `@Output()`.
- **Lazy-load** feature routes; avoid importing heavy modules in `AppModule` / root unless required.

## State & async

- Prefer **Signals** or explicit **NgRx** patterns already in the repo — do not mix strategies in one feature without a reason.
- Use **AsyncPipe** in templates where possible to avoid manual subscribe/unsubscribe leaks.
- Choose RxJS operators deliberately: `switchMap` for cancellation, `exhaustMap` for duplicate-submit guards, `catchError` at stream boundaries.

## Forms & validation

- **Reactive forms** for non-trivial flows; sync validators with server rules where applicable.
- Surface errors accessibly (ARIA, `aria-describedby`).

## Security

- **Never** bind untrusted HTML without sanitization; use Angular's `DomSanitizer` only with trusted patterns.
- Keep **tokens** out of logs and URLs where avoidable; align with the `security` rule.

## Performance

- **`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`** for leaf/presentational components when safe.
- Avoid heavy work in constructors; use lifecycle hooks or `effect()` / `computed()` as appropriate.
- Respect **bundle budgets** in `angular.json`.

## Testing

- **Jest** or **Karma/Jasmine** per project config; **Cypress** or **Playwright** for critical e2e paths.
- Test behaviors tied to **acceptance criteria**, not implementation trivia.
