# Web Application & API Security Requirements (MANDATORY)

The AI coding agent MUST follow all requirements below for **any** generated or modified code, regardless of programming language, framework, or runtime.

## 1. OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- All generated code **must be designed and written to prevent OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** (latest published version).
- If a requested change could introduce or worsen an OWASP Top 10 risk, the agent MUST:
  - Refuse the unsafe implementation, AND
  - Propose a secure alternative with explanation.

This includes but is not limited to:
- Broken access control
- Injection flaws
- Cryptographic failures
- Insecure design
- Security misconfiguration
- Vulnerable or outdated components
- Authentication and session management weaknesses
- Data integrity and SSRF issues

## 2. Mandatory Initialization & Safe Defaults
- Every variable, field, property, parameter, and data structure MUST:
  - Be explicitly initialized before use
  - Have a safe and predictable default value
- No uninitialized, nullable, or implicitly defined values unless strictly required and validated.

## 3. Input Size & Length Protection
- Any field, variable, or property that accepts user input or external data MUST:
  - Enforce reasonable maximum length limits based on intended usage
  - Validate input size **before processing**
  - Reject or safely handle over-limit input
- Unbounded strings, arrays, buffers, lists, or collections are NOT allowed.

## 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding
- All external input (user, API, file, network, environment) MUST:
  - Be validated for type, length, format, and allowed values
- All output rendered to clients, logs, or downstream systems MUST:
  - Be properly encoded or sanitized based on context (HTML, JSON, SQL, shell, etc.)

## 5. Authentication & Authorization
- Authentication logic MUST:
  - Use proven, industry-standard mechanisms
  - Never store or transmit secrets in plaintext
- Authorization MUST:
  - Be enforced server-side
  - Default to deny access unless explicitly allowed
- Role, permission, or ownership checks are REQUIRED for protected operations.

## 6. Cryptography & Secrets
- Cryptography MUST:
  - Use modern, vetted algorithms and libraries
  - Never implement custom cryptographic primitives
- Secrets (keys, tokens, passwords):
  - Must never be hardcoded
  - Must be loaded securely from approved secret stores or environment mechanisms

## 7. OSS Dependency & Supply Chain Security
- Open-source libraries and dependencies MUST:
  - Be actively maintained
  - Have no known critical vulnerabilities
- **Restricted or high-risk OSS packages are NOT allowed unless explicitly approved.**
- Any new dependency MUST be justified and documented.

## 8. Error Handling & Logging
- Errors MUST:
  - Fail securely
  - Never leak sensitive information (stack traces, secrets, internal paths)
- Logs MUST:
  - Avoid personal data, secrets, or credentials
  - Be structured and security-aware

## 9. Secure Design & Defense in Depth
- Code MUST:
  - Follow least privilege principles
  - Assume external systems and inputs are untrusted
  - Avoid single points of failure
- Security controls SHOULD be layered rather than relying on a single safeguard.

## 10. Security-First Refactoring
- When refactoring or extending code:
  - Security posture MUST be preserved or improved
  - No security control may be weakened or removed without explicit justification

If any requirement conflicts with a user request, **security requirements take precedence**.
