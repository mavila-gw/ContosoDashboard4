# Story: Create Saved View (v1)

> **Companion spec:** See `examples/example_feature_spec.md` (Saved Views for Reports).  
> This file is formatted to match **`starterkit.backlog`** output for SDD handoff.

---

## Traceability

| Artifact | Reference |
|----------|-----------|
| Requirement ID | `REQ-SAVED-VIEWS-001` |
| Spec | `examples/example_feature_spec.md` — § User Acceptance (save); § APIs `POST /api/saved-views`; § Observability |
| PRD / initiative | Reports — Saved Views (v1) |

---

## User Story

As an **analyst**, I want to **save my current filters and columns as a named view**, so that **I can quickly return to the same setup later**.

---

## INVEST check

| Letter | Note |
|--------|------|
| **I** | Deliverable without load/share stories if create+list exists; list can be minimal read for this slice. |
| **N** | API contract and naming rules negotiable pending Open Questions. |
| **V** | Directly supports repeated analyst workflows (spec Goals). |
| **E** | Team can size after answers on max views / naming rules—or spike 0.5d if needed. |
| **S** | Single outcome: persist one named view and confirm in UI. |
| **T** | Gherkin + 409 path cover done state. |

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

- **Given** I have applied filters and adjusted columns on the Reports page  
  **When** I click "Save View", enter a unique name, and confirm  
  **Then** the view is created via the API, appears in my list, and a success confirmation is announced to screen readers

- **Given** I attempt to save a view with a duplicate name  
  **When** I confirm  
  **Then** I see an accessible error and the API responds with 409

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Additional bundle size < 10 KB (gzip) if applicable; API p95 for create < 200 ms under 95th percentile load.
- **Security / privacy:** Auth via JWT; org-scoped authorization on `POST`; view names treated as user content — sanitize/display per XSS policy; no PII in URLs or telemetry payload.
- **Reliability:** Idempotent client retry safe (duplicate `Idempotency-Key` optional follow-up); DB unique constraint prevents silent duplicates.
- **Observability:** Emit `view_saved` with orgId/userId/viewId; no PII in payload; metric for duplicate-name (409) rate.
- **Accessibility:** Confirmation and errors exposed to assistive tech (ARIA live / role); focus management on dialog close per WCAG 2.1 AA target.

## Dependencies

> See `constitution.md` for active stack details.

- **Frontend:** reports module, saved-views component/service, route guard for auth
- **Backend:** `POST /api/saved-views`, service layer models, schema migration for table
- **Flag:** `feature.saved_views`

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Duplicate names** → enforce unique constraint at DB + clear UI validation (align with 409 AC).
- **Slow load times** → index filters; cache by user/org (later story if list grows).
- **Scope creep (share/load)** → keep v1 to create + minimal list; defer share/default per spec Non-Goals.

---

## Open Questions

- Max number of saved views per user?
- Naming rules and allowed characters?
- Confirm org-scoped uniqueness vs user-scoped only for name?

---

## Blockers for spec sign-off

**None** — pending resolution of Open Questions for product policy only; technical path is clear enough to start implementation with sensible defaults (documented in ADR if defaults chosen).

---

## Suggested Task Breakdown

- **Dev:** UI dialog + service + error handling for 409; API endpoint + model + schema migration; wiring & flag
- **Test:** unit tests (frontend + backend); integration; e2e for happy + duplicate path
- **Docs:** Update user help; OpenAPI schema; ADR for saved views storage
- **Data/Migration:** create table with unique (userId, name) or per policy from Open Questions
- **Feature Flag:** behind `feature.saved_views`; gradual rollout 5%→100%

---

## Validation Notes

- **Repo references:** Illustrative only — replace with real paths when copied into a repo (`reports/`, `api/saved_views/`, etc.).
- **Confidence:** High for flow; Med until Open Questions closed for limits and naming.
- **Unknowns:** Max views and naming rules — track in spec § Constraints or ADR.
- **Traceability summary (for `tasks.md`):** `REQ-SAVED-VIEWS-001` ↔ Create Saved View (v1) ↔ `POST /api/saved-views` + UI save dialog.
